## Installation instructions

Participants should install the `coq-metacoq-template` package via `opam`.

If you do not have Coq installed yet, we recommend using the [Coq platform](https://coq.inria.fr/download) to install.

If you do not already have an editor for Coq installed, we recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [VSCoq legacy plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=coq-community.vscoq1).

See also MetaCoq's [installation instructions](https://github.com/MetaCoq/metacoq/blob/main/INSTALL.md). If you have trouble installing, you can ask questions on MetaCoq's [Zulip channel](https://coq.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/237658-MetaCoq/).
